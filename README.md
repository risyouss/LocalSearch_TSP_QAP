Combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Quadratic Allocation Problem (QAP)[1], are complex challenges that require effective approaches to find quality solutions within a reasonable time frame. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of the local search algorithm applied to these two problems. We begin by presenting the basic algorithm of local search, followed by a discussion on mathematical modelling of TSP and QAP.

We also examine two well-known problem libraries: TSPLIB, which contains various instances of the TSP, and QAPLIB, which offers a variety of instances of the QAP. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we detail the different performance metrics used, such as solution cost, execution time and solution consistency.

In the results section, we present the performance of the local search algorithm on different instances of the TSP and QAP. We then compare our results with other similar studies including GA , QAP-GASA, RNN ,RNN Hybrid,
